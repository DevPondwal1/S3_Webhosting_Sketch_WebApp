# AWS Sketch Website using Terraform & GitHub Actions

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to deploy a static portfolio website on **AWS** using **Terraform** for Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and **GitHub Actions** for Continuous Deployment (CI/CD).

The infrastructure is automatically provisioned with Terraform, while every code push to the `main` branch triggers a GitHub Actions workflow that deploys the latest website files to Amazon S3.

## ⚙️ Infrastructure Created

Terraform provisions the following AWS resources:

* Amazon S3 Bucket
* Static Website Hosting
* Public Bucket Policy
* Public Access Configuration
* CloudFront Distribution
* Website Files Upload

---

## 📄 Website Features

* Responsive Design
* Portfolio Home Page
* About Section
* Skills Section
* Projects Section
* Contact Page
* Smooth Scrolling
* Mobile Friendly
* Vanilla HTML, CSS & JavaScript

---

## 🔄 CI/CD Workflow

Whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch:

1. GitHub Actions starts automatically.
2. AWS credentials are loaded from GitHub Secrets.
3. The workflow synchronizes the `website/` folder with the S3 bucket.
4. Updated files become available through CloudFront.

This enables automatic deployment without manually uploading files.

---

## 🛠️ How to Deploy

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/aws-static-website.git
cd aws-static-website
```

### 2. Configure AWS Credentials

Set up your AWS CLI credentials:

```bash
aws configure
```

Provide:

* AWS Access Key ID
* AWS Secret Access Key
* Region (for example, `us-east-1`)
* Output format (`json`)

---

### 3. Initialize Terraform

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
```

---

### 4. Review the Execution Plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

---

### 5. Create the Infrastructure

```bash
terraform apply
```

Type:

```text
yes
```

Terraform will create the AWS infrastructure and upload the website files.

---

### 6. Configure GitHub Secrets

Add the following repository secrets:

| Secret                | Description           |
| --------------------- | --------------------- |
| AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID     | AWS Access Key        |
| AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY | AWS Secret Access Key |
| AWS_REGION            | AWS Region            |
| S3_BUCKET             | Name of the S3 Bucket |

---

### 7. Automatic Deployment

After making changes to the website:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Updated website"
git push
```

GitHub Actions automatically deploys the latest files to the S3 bucket.
